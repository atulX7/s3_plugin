# S3 Plugin for Data Sources Connector Framework

## Installation:

```bash
pip install path_to_s3_plugin_directory

pip install s3-plugin


from s3_plugin.connector import S3Connector

# Initialize
s3 = S3Connector('YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY', 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY')

# Fetch data
data = s3.fetch_data('your_bucket_name', 'your_file_key')
print(data)



### 4. Distributing:

You can distribute the plugin in a few ways:

1. **Local Installation**: For internal use, users can install the plugin directly from the source code using pip.

    ```bash
    pip install ./s3_plugin
    ```

2. **PyPi**: If you intend to make the plugin public, you can package it and distribute it via PyPi. This way, users can install your plugin using `pip install s3-plugin`.

3. **Incorporate into Framework**: If you have a larger framework and you want this to be a plugin within that ecosystem, you'd have a centralized way to load and manage plugins.

### 5. Loading the Plugin in the Framework:

In your main framework, you'd dynamically load plugins. There are many ways to do this, but one common pattern is to use Python's `pkgutil` and `importlib` for dynamic imports. Your framework would scan a "plugins" directory or a specific entry point to discover and load plugins.

With this structure, adding new connectors (like one for Google Drive, SQL databases, etc.) becomes a matter of creating new plugins. The main framework can remain largely untouched as new data sources are added.
