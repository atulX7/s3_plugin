# 🚀 Data Sources Connector Framework 🚀

Welcome to the Data Sources Connector Framework! This plugin facilitates a sleek interface for connecting with AWS S3, allowing you to fetch and analyze data seamlessly. Let's get you started!

## 📦 Installation

Before diving in, ensure you've installed the plugin. Here's your roadmap:

1. Install directly from the directory:
    ```bash
    pip install path_to_s3_plugin_directory
    ```

2. Alternatively, you can install from PyPi:
    ```bash
    pip install s3-plugin
    ```

## 🕹 How to Use 

After installation, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Flask App**:
    ```bash
    python test.py
    ```

2. **Access the Interface**:
    Open your browser and visit: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

3. **Provide AWS Credentials**:
    - Enter your AWS Access Key.
    - Enter your AWS Secret Key.
    - Provide the S3 location in the format: `bucket_name/file_key`.

4. **Fetch Data**:
    Click on "Fetch Data" and you'll be informed about the local paths where your original and crawled data have been stored.

## 🌍 Distributing

Ready to share this incredible plugin? Here's your guide:

1. **Local Installation**: Optimal for in-house use. Colleagues can install the plugin directly from the source using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install ./s3_plugin
    ```

2. **PyPi**: Want to go public? Bundle it and distribute through PyPi, enabling users to simply execute:
    ```bash
    pip install s3-plugin
    ```

3. **Integrate into Framework**: If you're looking to amalgamate this into a broader framework, you can centralize the loading and management of such plugins for smoother operations.

## 🔄 Loading the Plugin in the Framework

Your primary framework can dynamically integrate plugins. While various methods are available, a prevalent pattern involves Python's `pkgutil` and `importlib` for dynamic imports. Typically, your framework would scan a "plugins" folder or a particular entry point to find and load available plugins.

📌 **Note**: With this methodology, incorporating additional connectors (like Google Drive, SQL databases, etc.) is a breeze. Simply design new plugins, and the primary framework remains largely unaltered, even as you enhance your data sources palette.

Happy Coding! 💻
